Once I stopped being a prime member, I<U+0092>m not treated like a <U+0093>king<U+0094> anymore, not even properly helped or respected!\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, I never asked to be treated like a king, but they do that just to keep you as a prime member.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo many times I called, chatted with Amazon services and gave my suggestions to contribute improve the customer experience. They never improve on anything, they keep employing people who barely speak english or don<U+0092>t have proper training to sort any kind of issues.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, if you<U+0092>re buying through a third party company, they do not defend or solve a problem for you, they throw responsibilities to the seller and yourself, they say you both should sort things out between you! Basically they allow anyone to use their platform to sell anything and don<U+0092>t care about the quality of the products they<U+0092>re selling or what type of company it is.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmazon also sells more expensive than others online platforms, so if their customer service is useless, takes ages to sort something out and do not defend customers interests first, then what<U+0092>s the point in buying with them??????\\r\\n\\r\\nThese days, all that matters for Amazon is MONEY, nothing else! They forget the basics, to make money you must take into account several aspects of a business, in order to keep customers happy and coming back!\\r\\n\\r\\nI spent thousands of pounds with Amazon since 2014, but now I<U+0092>m avoiding it at all costs, buying directly from sellers websites or from other platforms lime Ebay.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf there are more people like me out there, make yourself be heard with honest reviews like mine. It<U+0092>s the best way to make ourselves be respected and heard by a company that lost their way. Now they should lose their customers until they understand that their are the most important part of the business.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou have now lost me as a customer and your app is being deleted from my phone as soon as I finish typing this review.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don<U+0092>t feel like buying from a company run by hypocrites, greedy people who allow their employees no freedom to go to the toilet or go to have lunch, when the owners have the courage to spend millions to go to space, thanks to the exploitation that they do to their employees, treating them like slaves!\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 5,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2,\n          3,\n          4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2848,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2018-01-22\",\n          \"2021-07-30\",\n          \"2015-09-24\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
